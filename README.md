### HR Analytics Project Report

---

#### Overview:
This HR Analytics report, created using Power BI Desktop, analyzes employee attrition within a company. It provides insights into factors contributing to employee turnover, including demographics, salary, job roles, and experience levels. The report is structured around key performance indicators (KPIs) such as attrition rates, average employee age, salary, and years of experience, accompanied by detailed visualizations.

#### Key Metrics:
- **Total Employees:** 1,470
- **Total Attrition:** 237 employees
- **Attrition Rate:** 16.1%
- **Average Age:** 37 years
- **Average Monthly Salary:** $6,500
- **Average Experience:** 7 years

#### Insights:
1. **Attrition by Education:**
   - Employees with life sciences degrees constitute 38% of the total attrition, followed by medical, technical, and marketing degrees.
  
2. **Attrition by Age Group:**
   - The highest number of employees leaving the company falls within the age group of 26-35, with 116 employees, followed by 18-25 and 36-45 age groups.

3. **Attrition by Salary:**
   - Most attrition occurs in employees earning up to $5,000, with 163 employees in this salary range. As salary increases, attrition rates drop, with only 5 employees leaving in the $15,000+ range.
  
4. **Attrition by Job Role:**
   - Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives have the highest attrition, with 62 and 57 employees leaving, respectively. Research Scientists and Sales Representatives follow closely behind.

5. **Attrition by Experience:**
   - Employees with 0-5 years of experience show the highest attrition, indicating that early-career employees are more likely to leave. Employees with 15-20 years of experience have a significantly lower attrition rate.

6. **Attrition by Gender:**
   - There is a noticeable difference in attrition between genders. Male employees account for 140 of the total attrition, while female employees account for 79.

7. **Attrition by Department:**
   - The Research & Development department experiences the highest attrition, followed by the Sales and Human Resources departments.

#### Visualizations:
- **Attrition Rate by Education**: A pie chart showing the distribution of attrition across different educational backgrounds.
- **Attrition by Age Group**: A bar graph comparing the number of employees leaving across different age brackets.
- **Attrition by Salary**: A stacked bar chart breaking down attrition by salary categories.
- **Attrition by Job Role**: A detailed table illustrating the attrition figures across various job roles.
- **Attrition by Experience**: A line graph displaying the attrition rate as it relates to employee experience levels.

#### Conclusion:
The report reveals that younger employees and those with lower salaries are more likely to leave the organization. Roles in Sales and Laboratory Technician positions see higher turnover, and employees with less experience have a higher risk of attrition. These insights suggest areas where the company may need to focus its retention strategies, particularly for early-career professionals and employees in specific job roles.
